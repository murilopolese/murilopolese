<p>Sticky Radio was the result of a consultancy and prototyping work for Sveriges Radio. Their R&amp;D department was working on a “seamless experience” between the digital and analog radio broadcasting. I participated actively on the design process and developed a prototype of an app that would recognize which radio channel you were listening (something like a Shazam for Sveriges Radio) and display more information about it. It also gave an option to continue the stream from the device, transitioning seamlessly between the analog and digital.</p>

<p>The app was a mix of Cordova app, nodejs backend and AWS infrastructure (for audio fingerprinting). Also during the process I developed this library that helps to integrate with a third party audio fingerprinting service: <a href="https://github.com/murilopolese/acr-cloud">https://github.com/murilopolese/acr-cloud</a></p>
