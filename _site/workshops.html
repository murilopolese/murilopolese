                        <p>After the last workshop Taylor and I gave at Poplar Union we decided to explore more specifically the Kano range of products since they weren’t as performant as expected on a building scenario. The first two workshops were focused on how to present the app Make Art (that comes on the KanoOS) in a way we could introduce a more complex language after.</p>

                        <p>In early February 2018 Taylor and I set to give a few workshops called “Fun with motors”. We came up with this idea after a serie of small activities we have done together to brainstorm about how could we explore motors, building, GPIOs and Kano products together. We thought this was a way to expand the possibilities for schools and homes who have Kano Computers and are done or not interested on the content that comes on it already.</p>

                        <p>Yet on the first month after I joined Kano I hosted a table at Code Dojo Girls Girls Only edition. The day was dedicated to spark curiosity and build confidence on girls about technology. There was scratch, game development, robotics, python programming and I was in charge of a “make your own computer” workshop with computer kits from Kano.</p>

                        <p>While I was back home in Brazil for a couple of month I did a one month residency at O Parque, a creative hub, coworking space and studio. There I interacted with many creative professionals from street artists to local brands on a daily basis, experimenting and understanding how people would see and interact with the tools and approach to technology I was proposing.</p>

The goal was still the same although we updated the content and tools to focus even more on how to integrate and hack the new tools presented into everyone’s existing creative workflow.</p>

                        <p>After Kids Hack Day Hyper Island a lot of people came to us to ask about Kids Hack Day Club and any other events. We noticed a lot of parents, educators and curious grown ups asking about event they could attend as well. At the time, Kids Hack Day would allow children of all age to join but the main focus was the younger ones.</p>

The participants were interns from different Designits across the globe and the theme was “how can strategic design help the current refugee crisis”. My contribution as a mentor was to try pushing the concepts beyond the sticky notes and whiteboard to prototypes and validating their ideas through experiencing how people react to it.</p>

Before the fair started we gathered for one night to build as many examples and props for the booth as possible. It was a great opportunity for me to gather so many talented people people and be able to experiment and build together! Many of the things we created for that booth are still part of Strawbees and Quirkbot portfolio of main activities.</p>

                        <p>I was invited through Makerspark and <a href="https://pixelache.ac/">Pixelache</a> to give a Strawbees workshop at Paide, in Estonia during a gathering to advertise a residency program on the city’s community center. When I got there I was amazed by the strength of the ideas people were articulating around there. Paide is a small and very old town, not only old in history but most young people leave the city, making it less and less active and getting less and less funds from the government. Attracted by the low prices some old houses started to be demolished and replaced by modern commercial buildings.</p>

                        <p>Together with Carl Bastard I went to Vejle to join a national conference of schools who had or wanted to have a FabLab at their schools, mostly young children to high-school. The workshop we have planned was a classic Quirkbot activity: Build a moving creature with Strawbees and a pre-programmed Quirkbot in 20 to 30 minutes, suggest a few competitions like a races or battles and leave the participants to interact with each other creations.
A wide range of people attended to the workshop: Children, parents, teachers and other members of the school who were there to help decide on budgets for schools to invest in technology education.</p>

                        <p>During early days of Kids Hack Day, the main format was “one day events”. As people were asking more and more about next events and the subscription list was increasing I was invited to join the new format Kids Hack Day was trying out: Summer Camp.</p>

                        <p>The first time I got invited to give a lecture was by Paulo and Joe at Berghs. The idea was to get a class of Digital Art Direction and give a crash course on how to go from idea to prototype in a couple of days.</p>
