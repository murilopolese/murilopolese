                <p>During the past years I devoted part of my time to host, run and volunteer on workshops that aimed to improve the way we perceive and interact with technology. Here’s a list with some of the most meaningful and fun episodes:</p>

These new workshops would focus on how to present the app Make Art (that comes on the KanoOS) in a way we could introduce a more complex language.</p>

He invited me to give a 3 day lecture about how his students could extend their web knowledge beyond the browser into the physical world. We sold the workshop as Internet of Things although I do prefer to call it “A journey from atoms to bits and back again” or just “bits and atoms” for short.</p>

                        <p>In early February, my friend 2018 Taylor and I decided to give a few workshops called “Fun with motors”. We came up with this idea after a series of small activities we have done together to brainstorm about how could we explore motors, building, GPIOs and Kano products together. We thought this was a way to expand the possibilities for schools and homes who have Kano Computers and are done with the content that comes on it already.</p>

                        <p>During the first month after, I joined Kano I hosted a table at Code Dojo Girls Only edition. During the event, there were stations covering all sorts of content, like scratch, game development, robotics, python programming, etc. I was in charge of a “make your own computer” workshop with computer kits from Kano.</p>

                        <p>While I was back home in Brazil for a while I did a one month residency at <a href="http://www.oparque.com.br/">O Parque</a>, a creative hub, coworking space and studio. There, I interacted with many creative professionals from street artists to local brands on a daily basis, experimenting and understanding how people would see and interact with the tools and approach to technology I was proposing.</p>

It was interesting to notice that the most successful activity - that managed to engage people across all the very different groups - was the robot race.</p>

We noticed a lot of parents, educators and curious grown ups asking about event they could attend as well. Since Kids Hack Day was mainly focused on the younger ones, we decide to create a special event, more adult-oriented.</p>

                        <p>While working at <a href="https://www.designit.com/offices/sto">Designit in Stockholm</a> I was invited to be a mentor on a design bootcamp in Munich. The participants were interns from different Designit offices across the globe and the theme was “how can strategic design help the current refugee crisis”. My contribution as a mentor was to push the projects beyond the sticky notes and whiteboards, to actual prototypes and validation of their ideas through experiencing how people react to them.</p>

We ran a workshop with a classic Quirkbot activity: build a moving creature with Strawbees and a pre-programmed Quirkbot in 20 to 30 minutes. After the creatures were built, we suggested a few competitions like races or battles, so participants could interact with each other’s creations.</p>

                        <p>Following the success of <a href="/workshop/2014-06-kids-hack-day-summer-camp">2014’s Summer Camp</a>, we decided to go further and establish a Kids Hack Day Club that ran initially from Makerspark’s basement, then moved to a few rooms at Stadsgården and finally to Stockholm Makerspace, in 2016.</p>

                        <p>As everybody enjoyed the spring lectures, Paulo got invited again to give the same lecture and extended the invitation to me. I was more than happy to join again and the idea was very similar: Give a class of Copywriting students a crash course on rapid prototyping.</p>

                        <p>During early days of Kids Hack Day, the main format was “one day events”. As people kept asking for more and more about next events and the subscription list increased, I was invited to join the new format Kids Hack Day was trying out: Summer Camp.</p>

                        <p>The first time I got invited to give a lecture was by Paulo and Joe at Berghs. The idea was to get a class of Digital Art Direction and give a crash course on how to go from idea to prototype in a couple of days.</p>
