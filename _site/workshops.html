                <p>During the past years I devoted part of my time to host, run and volunteer on workshops that aimed to improve the way we perceive and interact with technology. Here’s a list with some of the most meaningful and fun episodes:</p>

                        <p>After the last workshop Taylor and I gave at Poplar Union we decided to explore more specifically the Kano range of products since they weren’t as performant as expected on a building scenario. The workshops were focused on how to present the app Make Art (that comes on the KanoOS) in a way we could introduce a more complex language after and how far could we get.</p>

                        <p>My great friend Pedro teaches web technologies at Vefskoli in Reykjavik. He invited me to give a 3 day lecture about how his students could extend their web knowledge beyond the browser to the physical world. We sold the workshop as Internet of Things although I do prefer to call it “A journey from atoms to bits and back again” or just “bits and atoms” for short.</p>

                        <p>In early February 2018 Taylor and I set to give a few workshops called “Fun with motors”. We came up with this idea after a serie of small activities we have done together to brainstorm about how could we explore motors, building, GPIOs and Kano products together. We thought this was a way to expand the possibilities for schools and homes who have Kano Computers and are done with the content that comes on it already.</p>

                        <p>Yet on the first month after I joined Kano I hosted a table at Code Dojo Girls Girls Only edition. The day was dedicated to spark curiosity and build confidence on girls about technology. There was scratch, game development, robotics, python programming and I was in charge of a “make your own computer” workshop with computer kits from Kano.</p>

                        <p>While I was back home in Brazil for a while I did a one month residency at O Parque, a creative hub, coworking space and studio. There I interacted with many creative professionals from street artists to local brands on a daily basis, experimenting and understanding how people would see and interact with the tools and approach to technology I was proposing.</p>

                        <p>Stockholm Chamber of Commerce donated Quirkbot kits to a list of schools in Sweden and as part of the delivery we would give a series of workshops with members from the organization, educators and students. The activity we reproduced with most success was the robot race and was the one that generated most engagement.</p>

                        <p>Joe invited Paulo and I to give a lecture about techniques and tools for rapid prototyping to another class at Berghs School of Communication.

                        <p>After Kids Hack Day Hyper Island a lot of people came to us to ask about Kids Hack Day Club and any other events. We noticed a lot of parents, educators and curious grown ups asking about event they could attend as well. At the time, Kids Hack Day would host children of all age to join but the main focus was the younger ones so we created a special KHD event focused on older ones.</p>

                        <p>While working at Designit in Stockholm I was invited to be mentor on a design boot camp in Munich. The participants were interns from different Designit offices across the globe and the theme was “how can strategic design help the current refugee crisis”. My contribution as a mentor was to push the projects beyond the sticky notes and whiteboard to prototypes and validation of their ideas through experiencing how people react to them.</p>

We ran a workshop with a classic Quirkbot activity: Build a moving creature with Strawbees and a pre-programmed Quirkbot in 20 to 30 minutes. After the build we suggested a few competitions like a races or battles and participants interacted with each other creations.</p>

                        <p>As everybody enjoyed the spring lectures, Paulo got invited again to give the same lecture and extended the invitation to me. I was more than happy to join again and the idea was very similar: Give a class of Copywriting students a crash course on rapid prototyping.</p>

                        <p>During early days of Kids Hack Day, the main format was “one day events”. As people were asking more and more about next events and the subscription list was increasing I was invited to join the new format Kids Hack Day was trying out: Summer Camp.</p>

                        <p>The first time I got invited to give a lecture was by Paulo and Joe at Berghs. The idea was to get a class of Digital Art Direction and give a crash course on how to go from idea to prototype in a couple of days.</p>
