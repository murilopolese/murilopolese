                <h2>Strawbees: ItLab November 2015</h2>
                <p>While working at Designit in Stockholm I was invited to be mentor on a design boot camp for in Munich. The participants were interns from different Designits across the globe and the theme was “how can strategic design help the current refugee crisis”. My contribution as a mentor was to try pushing the concepts beyond the sticky notes and whiteboard to prototypes and validating their ideas through experiencing how people react to it.</p>

<p>To present this idea and to begin talking about prototyping and collaborative process I hanged one strawbee connector from the ceiling and challenged the interns with a question: What is the widest thing they could build with Strawbees without touching the floor. After 20 minutes of building we reflected on why it’s important to continuously validate our ideas outside the whiteboard and most importantly, how to do it together.</p>
