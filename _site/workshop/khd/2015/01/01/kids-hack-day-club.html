                <h2>Kids Hack Day: Club (2015 - 2016)</h2>
                <p>Following the success of 2014’s Summer Camp, it was time to plan another camp when we decided to go further and establish a Kids Hack Day Club that would run initially from Makerspark basement but we soon moved to a few rooms at Stadsgården. Finally we moved to Stockholm Makerspace in 2016.</p>

<p>Kids Hack Day Club ran much as a maker/hackerspace, children would have access to equipaments, material, instructions (with or without instructors) and most importantly time to spend on their own projects or helping out other friends.</p>

<p>In the beginning I ran a series of Minecraft hacking sessions using a version of Minecraft that would only allow to modify the world through code. Later on I also ran robotics, 3D printing, hardware and software hacking workshops to get them excited and started with their own projects.</p>
