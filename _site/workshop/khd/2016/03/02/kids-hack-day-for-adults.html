                <h2>Kids Hack Day: KHD For Adults March and April 2016</h2>
                <p>After Kids Hack Day Hyper Island a lot of people came to us to ask about Kids Hack Day Club and any other events. We noticed a lot of parents, educators and curious grown ups asking about event they could attend as well. At the time, Kids Hack Day would allow children of all age to join but the main focus was the younger ones.</p>

<p>At the time I was working at Quirkbot developing content and curriculum activities and we decided to throw some sessions of Kids Hack Day for adults to test some of the activities, material and how inspiring would they be. Since the main target of those activities were educators and parents, Kids Hack Day for adults was a great chance to test how comfortable would grown ups be with the instructions.</p>
