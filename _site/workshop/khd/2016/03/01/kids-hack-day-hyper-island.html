                <h2>Kids Hack Day: Hyper Island March 2016</h2>
                <p>After Hyper Island bought Quirkbot kits for prototyping and development of projects, Hyper Island students organized a Kids Hack Day with it. Carl BÃ¤rstad and I joined the event as a volunteer and consultant both training the students and helping to design the event.</p>

<p>The event was drop in and went through the whole day. After going through a reception where participants would register themselves they entered in an open space with multiple stations. There was an inspiration station with examples of what they could build, free building with Strawbees, toy hacking and soldering, programming lights and motors and 3D printing.</p>
