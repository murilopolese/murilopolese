                <h2>Kano: Build your computer and code April and May 2018</h2>
                <p>After the last workshop Taylor and I gave at Poplar Union we decided to explore more specifically the Kano range of products since they weren’t as performant as expected on a building scenario. The first two workshops were focused on how to present the app Make Art (that comes on the KanoOS) in a way we could introduce a more complex language after.</p>

<p>Make Art is a coffee script based drawing environment that embrace some of the concepts from “turtle programming”. Ideally this would be an introduction to the Pixel Kit running a “turtle graphics” environment in Python.</p>

<p>The way we ran the first workshops was to allow children to play freely on the computer kit but requiring them to use at least 2 of the apps inside the OS: Make Minecraft and Make Art. For those who engaged in Make Art we would give design challenges that would either guide towards or propose a few concepts such as coordinates, colors and geometric shapes.</p>

<p>On the last session we used for the first time the Pixel Kit with the “turtle” environment to a children that was not challenged anymore with Make Art. I presented the basic commands with a question: What can you draw with it? After drawing a square, rectangle and a 7, I presented a folder with demos and examples and after a few minutes I was delighted to see the engagement in trying to modify a few characteristics on the games.</p>
