<p><strong>Hello! My name is Murilo, I am a Brazilian technologist</strong> (or a full stack developer if you prefer).</p>

<p>I am profoundly interested in education and technology. More specifically when technology is used to build a bridge between what we are able and what we desire. I believe technology can do wonders when used to extend who we are.</p>

<p>In this quest, I started studying Physics in 2007 at my hometown’s university (UFES) but dropped early on because becoming a developer was more urgent to me. As a developer, I worked in a range of places that in a way or another explored the possibilities and impacts of modern technology in our lives. In Brazil I worked from software houses to government’s culture department and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp4usRl-nSg">projection mapping art collective</a>, ending up running my own startup and <a href="http://sciencehackday.org/ambassador/">Science Hack Days</a>.</p>

<p>In 2014 I moved to Sweden where I worked as a creative technologist in a <a href="https://oakwood.se/">digital agency</a>, exploring how to make use of modern technology to create powerful and meaningful experiences through advertisement. I also worked as a consultant for a <a href="https://www.designit.com/">strategic design firm</a>.</p>

<p>Through all this time I’ve been involved with a non profit organization called <a href="http://www.kidshackday.com/">Kids Hack Day</a> where I had the pleasure to develop some of the features of <a href="https://strawbees.com/">Strawbees</a> and <a href="https://www.quirkbot.com/">Quirkbot</a>, toys designed to engage kids in perceiving that we can interact with technology in a more creative and active way, rather than passively consuming it.</p>

<p>Today I live in London and work for a company called <a href="https://kano.me/">Kano</a>, where we develop an end to end experience for beginners in technology. From putting together our own computers to sharing interests through a social network specially created for it, we can learn about technology as we create and make with it.</p>
