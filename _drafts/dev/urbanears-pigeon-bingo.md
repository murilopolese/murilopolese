[Oakwood](http://oakwood.se/) made a custom built cage where we let 25 pigeons sit above a grid of 25 plastic heads with Plattan ADV on them. Participants would have to visit urbanears.com and pick the five numbers they thought would get pooped on first, and the first ones to get “bingo” won a pair of Plattan ADV.

The pigeon bingo was live streamed on urbanears.com with six one-hour games in three days. Each game was turned into an interactive show with live commentators – like the Youtube star Sp4zie – who let viewers engage with the show via Twitter.

I worked as front end developer and managed part of the devOps for this project.
