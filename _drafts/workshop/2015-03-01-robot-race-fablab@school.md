Together with Carl Bastard I went to Vejle to join a national conference of schools who had or wanted to have a FabLab at their schools, mostly young children to high-school. The workshop we have planned was a classic Quirkbot activity: Build a moving creature with Strawbees and a pre-programmed Quirkbot in 20 to 30 minutes, suggest a few competitions like a races or battles and leave the participants to interact with each other creations.

A wide range of people attended to the workshop: Children, parents, teachers and other members of the school who were there to help decide on budgets for schools to invest in technology education.

I found this a quite unique opportunity to learn from so many different perspectives what people were expecting from the workshop and from the Quirkbots we were using. And also very glad that it was able to either give some fun moments to everyone that participated!

Besides giving the workshop we were also talking about Kids Hack Day and Quirkbot with a stand that took place near to other fantastic projects and companies such as Lego.
