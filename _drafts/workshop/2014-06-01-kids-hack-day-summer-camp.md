During early days of Kids Hack Day, the main format was “one day events”. As people were asking more and more about next events and the subscription list was increasing I was invited to join the new format Kids Hack Day was trying out: Summer Camp.

So in June 2014 I joined a few days for a couple of hours during the summer camp that happened at Makerspark’s basement and helped to develop and curate robotic activities. There was no Quirkbot hardware at that time and all robots were made with Arduinos, Strawbees, motors and rubber bands.
