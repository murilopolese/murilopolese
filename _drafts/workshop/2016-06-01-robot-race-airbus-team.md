While working for Quirkbot we were based at THINGS, a hardware focused startup accelerator, coworking space and home for Stockholm Makerspace. THINGS occupy a building at KTH and itâ€™s an international reference because of its installations, companies and community around it.

A group of managers from AirBus paid a visit to the building to learn and share their views about the future of the technology industry. During the visit they interacted with many companies on the building and with Quirkbot was a robot race workshop, as it should be!
