During the days we stayed at the booth next to the gift shop, apart from business and marketing related activities, we had a lot of fun. Before the fair started we gathered for one night to build as many examples and props for the booth as possible. It was a great opportunity for me to gather so many talented people people and be able to experiment and build together! Many of the things we created for that booth are still part of Strawbees and Quirkbot portfolio of main activities.
