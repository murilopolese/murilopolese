I was invited through Makerspark and [Pixelache](https://pixelache.ac/) to give a Strawbees workshop at Paide, in Estonia during a gathering to advertise a residency program on the city’s community center. When I got there I was amazed by the strength of the ideas people were articulating around there. Paide is a small and very old town, not only old in history but most young people leave the city, making it less and less active and getting less and less funds from the government. Attracted by the low prices some old houses started to be demolished and replaced by modern commercial buildings.

That is where Reiner, behind the community center, comes in. He’s life is dedicated to restore and protect the architecture of Paide, which is indeed special. Besides woodworking his project to protect the city’s architectural heritage was to host events such as the one I participated and invite young and engaged artist and activists to be residents or move to the city which has incredible low living costs and a growing artistic scene.

I gave a workshop more focused on using Strawbees as a tool to communicate ideas and arguments then the technical side. The activity was to build the widest hanging structure that wouldn’t touch the floor. After building we did a few rounds of reflection followed by very quick rebuilding sessions to consolidate what was said during the chat.
