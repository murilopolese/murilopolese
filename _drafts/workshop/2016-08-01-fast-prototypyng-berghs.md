As everybody enjoyed the spring lectures, Paulo got invited again to give the same lecture and extended the invitation to me. I was more than happy to join again and the idea was very similar: Give a class of Copywriting students a crash course on rapid prototyping.

The idea behind the workshop was to enable students to not wait until the technical support to arrive to start prototyping, with some simple tools and techniques everybody could experience and demonstrate complex concepts with simple prototypes.

This time we still used Processing and Makey Makeys but we also used Arduinos for motor outputs and [Spacebrew](http://docs.spacebrew.cc/) for connecting hardware and software over the internet.

We made a game to demonstrate how to control a servo motor with software, hardware and over the internet:
