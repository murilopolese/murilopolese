While I was back home in Brazil for a couple of month I did a one month residency at O Parque, a creative hub, coworking space and studio. There I interacted with many creative professionals from street artists to local brands on a daily basis, experimenting and understanding how people would see and interact with the tools and approach to technology I was proposing.

To start the residency I organized a workshop very much inspired by the ones at Berghs School of Communication, where participants would imagine and prototype an interactive experience with an activity from their day to day lives.
