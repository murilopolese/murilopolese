In April 2020 I have worked with [Super Beast](https://superbeast.co) on an interactive logo for the cover for their home page. This project was a real pleasure to work on, mixing the right amount of creative freedom and tight art direction.

This project was a mix of generative and semi-random movements exploring heavily undulatory movement and personal observations on ciliated single cell organisms.

I made it with a custom build of P5JS that is optimised to have almost only what I used to implement the animation and interaction. You can check the code on [Github](https://github.com/murilopolese/superbeast) and see a [demo page only with the animation](https://superbeast.herokuapp.com/) and the [and a few other pieces from the process](https://github.com/murilopolese/superbeast/tree/6028ff91db224adbcf33bcd663451732a1128fe2).
