If you have ever seen or played with a [MakeyMakey](https://makeymakey.com/), you probably played piano or bongo with a household object, perhaps a fruit or cutlery. The [Piano](https://apps.makeymakey.com/piano/) and [Bongos](https://apps.makeymakey.com/bongos/) apps are a success to onboard and to score a smile on everyone’s face. But why being limited to piano and bongos sounds only?

With this question in mind I had the honour to brainstorm, prototype, design, develop and release a sampler app for MakeyMakey.  Our dream was to create an app where people could play and create beyond the classic apps. It’s a real joy to work with JoyLabz team!

I have also made a tutorial showing a few of my favorite features:
