[Pixel32](https://murilopolese.github.io/kano-pixel-kit-pixel32-docs/) is a wireless coding experience on Kano's Pixel Kit. It uses MicroPython and it's "self hosted", meaning you can access it offline through a local network created by the Pixel Kit.

The idea was to provide a more "advanced" environment for people who had graduated on the original Pixel Kit block based programming environment but also try to deliver what the product promised from the beginning: To be a portable platform for creative coding. The project was halted as the product got discontinued.

The technical part of the project on other hand succeeded and it's free and open source. I made [a tool](https://github.com/murilopolese/kano-pixel-kit-flash-tool) to erase, replace and rollback the firmware in case anyone wants to use Kano Code ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. There are a few Instructables [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Flashing-MicroPython-on-Kano-Pixel-Kit/) and [there](https://www.instructables.com/id/Pixel-Kit-Running-MicroPython-First-Steps/) too.

I also made a bunch of videos in which I explore the features of the board and MicroPython on awkward silent videos. You can find them on the [Tutorials](https://murilopolese.github.io/kano-pixel-kit-pixel32-docs/tutorials).
