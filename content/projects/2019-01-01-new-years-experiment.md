<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/313494443">New Year&#039;s Experiment</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/grandinetti">Bee Grandinetti</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

I have been into drawing machines and digital fabrication. I usually try building machines made out of widely available materials such as plastic, cardboard, tape, strings, etc. While it gets me a special type of satisfaction to build from scratch using very simple materials, reliability and precision were not the strength of those builds.

How hard could it be to stick a pen on a 3D printer and start drawing? To my surprise it was not hard at all and after 3 iterations (and a few video tutorials) I had a very satisfactory process and an actual amazing result.

The first results were actually fantastic: [https://www.instagram.com/p/Br3rruJjB6-/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Br3rruJjB6-/)

When Bee saw that, she got so excited! I was so happy that we set to do something together with that technique. We had this idea to make a new years card to send to some of our friends but each card would be a frame of a stop motion animation we would make with the prints.

After printing the 24 frames, which took about 6 hours spread on 2 or 3 days, Bee did her magic with photos, colors, corrections and made the stop motion animation. Not enough she made a soundtrack and added “behind the scenes” footage. So much talent!
