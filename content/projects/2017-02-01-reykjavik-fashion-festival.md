Around February 2017 I got in touch with [Serious Business](http://seriousbusiness.agency/). This agency with a fun name and a ridiculously talented team was working on [Reykjavik's Fashion Festival](https://serious.business/case/rff/) branding and website. After reading the deck with ideas they had for the project, I was immediately convinced to jump in, not really caring about the specifics of my role.

I worked on a tool they used to explore and export a visual piece that represented one of the natural elements present in the branding: Wind. I kept their initial setup on processing mostly adding some performance and GUI. You can [check the code on this gist](https://gist.github.com/murilopolese/3d7de2f5ef30d36737273567ff96795e).
