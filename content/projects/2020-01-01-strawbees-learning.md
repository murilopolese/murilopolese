When I joined Strawbees in early 2019 I knew I was up to work on any task and I couldn't think of a single thing we had to do that I wouldn't pick to work with. From June 2019 to April 2020 I worked as product owner, scrum master, head of education, content creator and fullstack developer in collaboration with a small but ultra talented team to bring [Strawbees Learning](https://learning.strawbees.com) to life.

In this project I was able to use my knowledge on building reproducible physical things and my expertise as fullstack developer, have implemented both [backend](https://github.com/strawbees/learning-cms) and [frontend](https://github.com/strawbees/learning-platform-gatsby) using WordPress and Gatsby.

The thing I'm most proud of in this project is how we translated our experience after years using Strawbees into how we suggest the world to use it. From  [https://learning.strawbees.com/strawbees-learning/](https://learning.strawbees.com/strawbees-learning/):

> Strawbees is not only about making things, but the environment in which they are made. We want to create a learning environment that helps children engage in projects that reflect their ideas and how they see the world. This is readily done through student-centered projects that invite children to explore the variety and versatility of what Strawbees has to offer.
