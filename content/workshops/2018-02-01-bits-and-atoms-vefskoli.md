excerpt: "My great friend Pedro Netto teaches web technologies at Vefskoli in Reykjavik. He invited me to give a 3 day lecture about how his students could extend their web knowledge beyond the browser into the physical world. We sold the workshop as Internet of Things although I do prefer to call it “A journey from atoms to bits and back again” or just “bits and atoms” for short."

My great friend [Pedro](https://brisa.is/) teaches web technologies at [Vefskoli](https://vefskoli.is/) in Reykjavik. He invited me to give a 3 day lecture about how his students could extend their web knowledge beyond the browser into the physical world. We sold the workshop as Internet of Things although I do prefer to call it “A journey from atoms to bits and back again” or just “bits and atoms” for short.

The course was all about the journey electricity does from the browser to the boards and back again. It covered basic electronics, microprocessors, general purpose input and output devices and networks. It’s quite a journey so the main goal for the course was not to go super deep in any step specifically but to experience superficially the whole process by playing with demos, experiments and challenges.

[You can check the material for the workshop here](https://github.com/murilopolese/bits-and-atoms).

Naturally, students and teachers found where their major interest was during in the journey and were able to deeper understand something they were curious about or find out entirely new worlds to explore.
