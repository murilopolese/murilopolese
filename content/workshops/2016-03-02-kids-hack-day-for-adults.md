After we hosted [Kids Hack Day Hyper Island](./workshop/2016-03-kids-hack-day-hyper-island) a lot of people came to us to ask about Kids Hack Day Club and other events. We noticed a lot of parents, educators and curious grown ups asking about event they could attend as well. Since Kids Hack Day was mainly focused on the younger ones, we decide to create a special event, more adult-oriented.

At the time I was working at Quirkbot, developing content and curriculum activities. So we decided to use some of those Kids Hack Day for adults sessions to test activities, materials and analyze how inspiring they would be for that audience. Since a lot of the participants were educators and parents, Kids Hack Day for adults was also a great opportunity to test how comfortably grown ups with that background handle the product's instructions.
