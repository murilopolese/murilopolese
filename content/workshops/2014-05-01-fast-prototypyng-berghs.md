The first time I got invited to give a lecture was by Paulo and Joe at Berghs. The idea was to get a class of Digital Art Direction and give a crash course on how to go from idea to prototype in a couple of days.

Students were divided into groups, each one with a fictional brief for a real brand and they would end up the course with a pitch that included some prototype action. The main outcome wouldn’t be the pitch itself but a “making of” for the process.

To do that we gave a small introduction on Processing and taught them how to setup Makey Makeys to interact with the Processing sketches.

This was the material we used:
