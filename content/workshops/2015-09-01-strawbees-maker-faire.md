During the days I joined the 2015 Maker Faire as part of the Strawbees gang, we set a booth next to the gift shop and had a lot of fun, apart from business and marketing related activities.

Before the fair started we gathered for one night of intense building with the goal to invent as many examples and props for the booth as possible- and had a great time during it!

It was a huge opportunity for me to be around so many talented and inspiring people and be able to experiment and build together! Many of the things we created for that booth are still part of Strawbees and Quirkbot portfolio of main activities.

During the event, our booth functioned as a drop in, building party. Anyone could come, sit and play as much as they wanted with guided introductions provided by us, playing with the examples or digging through the bags of Strawbees and straws themselves to build their own ideas.
