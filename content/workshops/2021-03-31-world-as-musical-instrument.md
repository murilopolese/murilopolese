We gathered at [Blivande](http://www.blivande.com) to have a little bit of a play and test session for an app I'm working with: The [Makey Makey Sampler](https://makeymakey.com/sampler).

In the past I have done workshops around using objects of our daily lives as computer interface. During those workshops a wide range of experiences are explored: Playing games, drawing, improving workflow and making sounds.

Because of my underlying goal to test the sampler app, this workshop was centred around music and triggering sounds.

Most people who came in had never touched a Makey Makey before yet they have all been able to inspect and explore the material and its potential for musicality.
