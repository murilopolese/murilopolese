During early days of Kids Hack Day, the main format was “one day events”. As people kept asking for more and more about next events and the subscription list increased, I was invited to join the new format Kids Hack Day was trying out: Summer Camp.

So in June 2014 I  joined the camp at Makerspark’s basement for a few days and helped developing and curating robotic activities. There was no Quirkbot hardware at that time and all robots were made with Arduinos, Strawbees, motors and rubber bands.
