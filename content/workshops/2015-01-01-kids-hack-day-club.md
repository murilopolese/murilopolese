Following the success of [2014’s Summer Camp]("/workshop/2014-06-kids-hack-day-summer-camp), we decided to go further and establish a Kids Hack Day Club that ran initially from Makerspark's basement, then moved to a few rooms at Stadsgården and finally to Stockholm Makerspace, in 2016.

Kids Hack Day Club ran as a maker/hackerspace. Children would have access to equipaments, material, instructions (with or without instructors) and, most importantly, time to spend on their own projects or helping out other friends.

In the beginning, I ran a series of Minecraft hacking sessions using a version of Minecraft that would only allow to modify the world through code. Later on I also ran robotics, 3D printing, hardware and software hacking workshops to get them excited and started with their own projects.
