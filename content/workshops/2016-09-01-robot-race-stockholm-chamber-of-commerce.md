Stockholm Chamber of Commerce donated Quirkbot kits to a list of schools in Sweden and as part of the delivery we would give a series of workshops with members from the organization, educators and students. It was interesting to notice that the most successful activity - that managed to engage people across all the very different groups - was the robot race.
