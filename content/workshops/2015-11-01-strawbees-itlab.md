While working at [Designit in Stockholm](https://www.designit.com/offices/sto) I was invited to be a mentor on a design bootcamp in Munich. The participants were interns from different Designit offices across the globe and the theme was “how can strategic design help the current refugee crisis”. My contribution as a mentor was to push the projects beyond the sticky notes and whiteboards, to actual prototypes and validation of their ideas through experiencing how people react to them.

To introduce the theme of prototyping and collaborative process I hanged one strawbee connector from the ceiling and challenged the interns with a question: What is the widest thing they could build with Strawbees without touching the floor. After 20 minutes of building we reflected on why it’s important to continuously validate our ideas outside the whiteboard and most importantly, how to do it together.
