During the first month after, I joined Kano I hosted a table at Code Dojo Girls Only edition. During the event, there were stations covering all sorts of content, like scratch, game development, robotics, python programming, etc. I was in charge of a “make your own computer” workshop with computer kits from Kano.

After putting together their computers and booting their operating systems, girls from a wide range of ages used programming languages to draw, hack minecraft and pong on the computer kits. The reception was fantastic and it’s always heart-warming to experience a new perspective unfolding in front of a young mind. It is especially important when this happens to youth who social or gender circumstances would put them on an underprivileged situation.

[I wrote a blog post on Kano’s blog about it!](https://kano.me/blog/we-attended-a-coder-dojo-girls-only-hackathon-it-was-awesome/)
