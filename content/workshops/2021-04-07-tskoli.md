My friend [Pedro](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/pedronetto) invited me to give a 3 day online workshop for his web development students at [Tskoli](https://www.tskoli.is/). The workshops were part of a module for expanding students horizons on what they could do with the skills they learned through the course.

I choose to give a creative coding focused workshop very much inspired by the [Recreating the Past](https://sfpc.io/recreatingthepast-spring2020/) course [I took](http://gallery.bananabanana.me/) at the School for Poetic Computation.

We talked about the [Vasulkas](http://gallery.bananabanana.me/research/vasulkas.html) and picked a few of their work to recreate in order to revisit some of the programming structures they have learned such as for looks, colors and arrays.

The days started with a technical lecture followed by a recreation and a live coding Q&A:

- Getting started with p5js
- Color and Basic shapes
- For loops
- Animation
- Map function
- Keyboard and mouse
- Images
