While I was back home in Brazil for a while I did a one month residency at [O Parque](http://www.oparque.com.br/), a creative hub, coworking space and studio. There, I interacted with many creative professionals from street artists to local brands on a daily basis, experimenting and understanding how people would see and interact with the tools and approach to technology I was proposing.

To start the residency I organized a workshop very much inspired by the ones [I had previously hosted at Berghs School of Communication]("/tag/berghs), where participants would imagine and prototype an interactive experience with an activity from their day to day lives.

I considered the workshop a success based on the different, exciting and unexpected projects that came out from it. The groups not only nailed the process of creation but also the project presentation, where they shared the most exciting and frustrating parts.
