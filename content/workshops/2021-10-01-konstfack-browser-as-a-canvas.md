[Clara Terne](http://www.claraterne.com/) is senior lecturer at [Konstfack](https://www.konstfack.se/en/), University of Arts, Crafts and Designs in Stockholm. She invited me to give a few lectures for graphic design students and I promptly accept!

She gave the first introductory class with a classic and every exciting exercise on instructional design by breaking down and recreating artworks as a set of instructions.

I followed up this class with a lecture called "Browser as a Canvas" where I talk about my practice as using the web browser and web technologies as a platform and medium for artistic practices.

We went through basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript but focused on recreating artworks from relevant artists using P5JS. We recreated Hilma Av Klint, classic Swedish rug patterns and more.

By the end of the course I made a gallery with student's work and reflected on how can code and the web browser influence the way we think and perform.
