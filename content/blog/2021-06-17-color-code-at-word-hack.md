[Babycastles](https://www.babycastles.com/) is a NYC based collective fostering and amplifying diverse voices in videogame culture. We provide artists support to actualize ideas and expose that work to new audiences.

[WordHack](https://toddwords.com/wordhack/) is a monthly evening of performances and talks exploring the intersection of language and technology.

I got pretty excited when [Todd](https://toddwords.com/) replied my application to talk about Color Code at WordHack. The idea of talking about a programming language without words at an event about words and language made me happy and confused about what should I talk about.

This was a great chance to also share a new version of Color Code with a new interface that you can use the mouse do draw and making rules is slightly less confusing.

It was also the first time I officially presented Color Code as a project and beyond sharing how to write simple programs without words, I wanted to talk a little bit about why is it important, how did I get here and what are the guiding questions that are floating in my head when I'm developing, exploring and playing with Color Code.

![Mindstorms, Technological Sovereignity and Decolonizing the Digital](./wordhack_bookcovers.png)

Books like [Mindstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindstorms_(book)) and [Decolonizing the Digital](http://ojs.decolonising.digital/index.php/decolonising_digital/issue/view/DecolonisingTheDigital) as well as the [Technological Sovereignity zine](https://sobtec.gitbooks.io/sobtec2/content/en/) have pretty much shaped the way I think about this project as well as getting myself completely confused with millions of questions to ask!

- Can this computation make sense when we decide that **mining and mass manufacturing are not good ideas**?
- Can this programming language allow a tiny simple computers to be programmed **without a bigger and more complex computers**?
- How many buttons do you need to write a program **comfortably and creatively**?
- Is it possible to have a programming language you **donâ€™t need to learn how to read words first**? (Or read words in a specific language, let's say, English)

Just to be clear, I don't think Color Code is an answer to those questions but my attempt to build, experience and attempt to answer them. I also think some of those questions are easier than others and some I can't answer by myself.

Another highlight of this presentation for me was to say thanks to a couple of dear people who helped (and are still helping!) me in many ways to develop Color Code! Namely [Max Bittker](http://maxbittker.com), [Luke Wilson](http://patreon.com/todepond), [Dave Ackley](www.livingcomputation.org) and [Andrew Walpole](https://andrewwalpole.com/), THANK YOU VERY MUCH! <3
