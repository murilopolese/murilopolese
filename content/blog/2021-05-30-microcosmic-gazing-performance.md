[CCTV Stockholm](https://cctvsthlm.se/) is an audiovisual and community concept, documenting and developing the cultural scene in Stockholm.

Visualia is an ultra-experimental concept that encourages radical interdisciplinary collaborations within performance, installation and visual art.

Paulo Barcelos and I got invited by [Jonas Johanson](https://jonasjohansson.se/) to make a [visual performance](https://vimeo.com/556817932/470af4d117) out of our favourite microcosmic samples. We used a tool Paulo made 10 years ago for an [installation at Stockholm’s subway](https://vimeo.com/58182488). It’s has a node based visual programming language that we used to perform live coding of effects and compositions.

[You can watch the 45 minutes performance on Vimeo (ours starts around 3h35m)](https://vimeo.com/556817932/470af4d117)!

We used two microscopes and a few drops of water from an early spring puddle. I enjoyed particularly the effects that traced lines and textures on screen.

A day before this performance my heart was in the streets of Brazil screaming and signalling unconformity against the Bolsonaro and the genocide politics it represents.
