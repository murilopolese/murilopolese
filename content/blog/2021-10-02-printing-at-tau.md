Around May this year I was [looking into making a new round of research and development around drawing machines](https://forum.blivande.com/t/printing-at-taus-artist-in-residency-room/2428). I would usually do this at home but this time it seemed so obvious I should have [Blivande](https://www.blivande.com/) as the background for this chapter in my life!

It was a very experimental, collaborative, kids friendly and welcoming process. Some people showed up, many interesting conversations happened and a few workshop moments! I took time to watch, listen and *feel* the movements.

I had a 4 week plan:

1. Simple drawing machines with Strawbees, Quirkbot and other household material
2. Simple CNCs with cardboard and DIY electronics
3. 3D Printers and AxiDraw
4. “Exhibition” in the room (Didn't happen, though!)

**Journal**

I kept a journal taking notes on what I tried, what failed, what I liked, conversations, keywords, ideas and much [more here](http://wiki.bananabanana.me/education/drawing-machines). There are also some stuff on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQB5JQyDVgn/).
