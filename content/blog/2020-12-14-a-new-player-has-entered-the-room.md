So I wrote [Color Code](http://www.murilopolese.com/blog/2020-11-color-code) and recorded a video explaining how it works but as expected, not a lot of people engaged. It's a weird, complicated, challenging theme sometimes. But it was there and I was and still am super happy with it.

It happens that [Max Bittker](https://maxbittker.com/), which is this amazing human being I met as teacher assistant on [Recreating the Past](http://www.murilopolese.com/blog/2020-07-school-for-poetic-computation), saw Color Code and realised we were working on similar projects! He sent me his [Alchemy Online](https://maxbittker.github.io/alchemy-online/) project and yes, in many, many ways, Alchemy Online is what I was trying to achieve with Color Code.

Max is one of the most knowledgeable people I know on this subject and not only I learned new terms like "spacial programming" and cool video game titles, I also learned new names like [Luke Wilson](https://www.instagram.com/todepond/), [Dave Ackley](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~ackley/), [Andrew Walpole](https://andrewwalpole.com/) and many more that I'm still checking out.

Interacting with those people has inspired me so much that I am even experimenting with a "mouse-only" interface to program in a variation of [SPLAT](https://github.com/DaveAckley/SPLAT) (Spacial Programming Language ASCII Text) that is much smaller and less capable version of the language because well, I'm a beginner! This really stretches my mind!

To be honest I don't fully understand the depth of thinking that goes on the thought or real hardware experiments that goes with [Living Computation](https://www.livingcomputation.org/) and [T2Tile](https://t2tile.org/) projects. Those are such new and fresh ideas for me.

But I have wandered around for a little while thinking on problems like [BITPICT](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/course/2006/media/papers/bitpict_chi91.pdf) and [SPLAT](https://github.com/DaveAckley/SPLAT) and I have never seen it so clearly proposed and discussed as those two projects.

One beautiful day I was having breakfast and watching the new [T2Tile project video update](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1M91QuLZfCzHjBMEKvIc-A) thinking about event windows, how cool is that Dave Ackley is writing a novel and how to get a DIY version of the MFM when suddenly:

And it's not that I was looking for it but I felt so happy and grateful to have people I admire so much waving to me from the cyberspace.

I'll make Dave's words mine here:

> Everybody talks about how internet allows you to find your audience no matter what it is, but it's not just a flood, it doesn't have to go viral to have each person that finds it feel really happy.

Thank you all <3
