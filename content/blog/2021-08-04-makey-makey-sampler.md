> In the spring of 2021, we designed and built our own Audio Sampler App because we saw the demand from the music community for a simple tool to be able to mix sounds and music with Makey Makey.

This is how [Makey Makey blog post about the Sampler](https://makeymakey.com/blogs/blog/check-out-our-sampler-app) starts. It's pretty cool to read it and think this is probably the first project I ever worked as "designer".

I would never have done it without a great team helping, guiding and making hard decisions. I believe this is how good work is done: In collaboration, constant conversation and improvement. I owe so much to [Colleen](https://twitter.com/gravescolleen) who led the team and project in such a insightful and joyful way!

It was also the first time I recorded a video tutorial that was published outside of my small social network. I was pretty scared. This video was only supposed to be a video from me to Colleen with my thoughts on how to explain the sampler. Making a more formal presentation in English is something that scares me a bit but Colleen was very encouraging, as always!

And as if it was not enough of an honor and privilege, at the end of the blog post there is a "meet the software dev" section talking about me. Can you believe it?

It's hard to say how happy and grateful I am for all of this. In the past when I was sad and tired, resisting the obstacles of following my own values about technology and education, I would always come to [Makey Makey Kickstarter video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU) and [Jay Silver's video about invention literacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibrwte1QqUE) to restore my faith in what's possible.

It's pretty crazy to think I got to meet and learn from people I admire so much. I am looking forward to do more with JoyLabz and grow as a person, learning from the fabulous human beings that I got to meet there!
