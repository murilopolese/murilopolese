> After the war Russia started with Ukraine I felt for the first time how much Instagram was directly affecting my mental health. It was doing so in the way it would display, silence, split and commodify the catastrophe that was happening in front of everyone's eyes. Fuck you, Russia! Fuck you, Putin! Fuck you, Zuckerberg!

I left Instagram grieving and dealing with anxiety and isolation because of all the "free time" I had while I was not feeding app's addiction.

On my "free time" I was trying to keep in touch with friends and family, learning, experimenting, doing daily creative exercises and all of that. When I was on Instagram, I'd pick some of this experimentation and share. Currently I do the same but I post on [sunbeam.city](https://sunbeam.city/@murilove) and I'm very happy about it! Thank you [@notplants](https://sunbeam.city/web/@notplants)!

All the creative stuff was documented in a sloppy way on a simple computer folder. I really like it! So much that I generate a simple, static gallery website from it and publish online.

It's called [**dumpster**](http://dumpster.bananabanana.me) because I was thinking of dumpster diving. But it could also be called **compost** because in many times I come back to this gallery for new inspiration.
