**Hello! My name is Murilo, I am a Brazilian technologist** (or a full stack developer if you prefer).

I am profoundly interested in learning experiences and technology. But I'm equally interested in music and drawing machines.

If you are smiling after reading this, please get in touch and let's have a chat!
