**Hello! My name is Murilo, I am a Brazilian technologist** (or a full stack developer if you prefer).

I am profoundly interested in education (as in learning experiences) and technology.

I started studying Physics in 2007 at my hometown’s university (UFES). There I did internships working as an educator in a program for children at social risk and at a science museum located in an underpriviledged neighborhood. I also got involved with the modeling laboratory where I helped to develop software simulations to be used by teachers in the classroom. Eventually I dropped the course because becoming a developer was more urgent to me.

As a developer, I worked in a range of places that in a way or another explored the possibilities and impacts of modern technology in our lives including software houses, government’s culture department, [projection mapping art collective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp4usRl-nSg), running my own startup and later becoming [Science Hack Day Ambassador](http://sciencehackday.org/ambassador/).

In 2014, I moved to Sweden where I worked as a creative technologist in a [digital agency](https://oakwood.se/), as a consultant for a [strategic design firm](https://www.designit.com/) and first got involved with a non profit organization called [Kids Hack Day](http://www.kidshackday.com/). While volunteering at Kids Hack Day I had the pleasure to develop some of the features of [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/) and [Quirkbot](https://www.quirkbot.com/), toys designed to engage kids in perceiving that we can interact with technology in a more creative and active way, rather than passively consuming it.

In 2017 I moved to London where I worked for a company called [Kano](https://kano.me/), developing [desktop apps](https://kano.me/landing/app/uk), [website](https://world.kano.me/challenges) and [embed software](https://murilopolese.github.io/kano-pixel-kit-pixel32-docs/).

In 2019 I went back to work (and play) with my beloved friends at [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/) where I play different roles developing software and content with educational focus.
