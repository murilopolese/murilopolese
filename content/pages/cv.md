## A bit of my history

I started studying Physics in 2007 at my hometown’s university (UFES). There I did internships working as an educator in a after school program and science museum, both targeting children in social risk. I also got involved with the modeling laboratory where they developed software simulations to be used by teachers and students in classroom in times when projectors were starting to arrive in the classrooms. Eventually I dropped the course and became a developer due to the financial pressures of being a teacher in Brazil.

As a developer I worked in a range of places that dealt with the impacts of modern technology in our lives including "software houses", government’s culture department, [projection mapping art collective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp4usRl-nSg) and running my own startup. I also became a [Science Hack Day Ambassador](http://sciencehackday.org/ambassador/)!

In 2014, I moved to Sweden where I worked as a creative technologist in a [digital agency](https://oakwood.se/), as a consultant for a [strategic design firm](https://www.designit.com/) and first got involved with a non profit organisation called [Kids Hack Day](http://www.kidshackday.com/). While volunteering at Kids Hack Day I had the pleasure to develop some of the features of [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/) and [Quirkbot](https://www.quirkbot.com/), toys designed to engage kids in perceiving that we can interact with technology in a more creative and active way, rather than passively consuming it.

In 2017 I moved to London where I worked for a company called [Kano](https://kano.me/), developing [desktop apps](https://kano.me/landing/app/uk), [website](https://world.kano.me/challenges) and [embed software](https://murilopolese.github.io/kano-pixel-kit-pixel32-docs/).

In 2019 I went back to work (and play) with my beloved friends at [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/) where I play different roles developing software and content with educational focus.

I'm actively looking for new work related opportunities, meaningful collaborations and learning experiences.
