**Short version:**

I have worked as full stack software developer, creative technologist, consultant and leading R&D projects for the past 10+ years. I have experience developing interactive media for art installations, advertisement campaigns as well as developing and maintaining robust systems, databases, embedded software and infrastructure. For the past 5 years I leveraged on my training as Physics teacher and focused on my real passion: Empowering through playful education. I worked with companies such as [Kano](https://kano.me), Quirkbot, [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/) and [JoyLabz](https://joylabz.com/). I also participate, run and am an ambassador of [Science Hack Day](http://sciencehackday.org/ambassador/) and [Kids Hack Day](https://www.kidshackday.com/about) hackathons.

**Long version:**

I started studying Physics in 2007 at my hometown’s university (UFES). There I did internships working as an educator in a after school program and science museum, both targeting children in social risk. I also got involved with the modeling laboratory where they developed software simulations to be used by teachers and students in classroom in times when projectors were starting to arrive in the classrooms. Eventually I dropped the course and became a developer due to the financial pressures of being a teacher in Brazil.

As a developer I worked in a range of places that dealt with the impacts of modern technology in our lives including "software houses", government’s culture department, [projection mapping art collective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp4usRl-nSg) and running my own startup. I also became a [Science Hack Day Ambassador](http://sciencehackday.org/ambassador/)!

In 2014, I moved to Sweden where I worked as a creative technologist in a [digital agency](https://oakwood.se/), as a consultant for a [strategic design firm](https://www.designit.com/) and first got involved with a non profit organisation called [Kids Hack Day](http://www.kidshackday.com/). While volunteering at Kids Hack Day I had the pleasure to develop some of the features of [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/) and [Quirkbot](https://www.quirkbot.com/), toys designed to engage kids in perceiving that we can interact with technology in a more creative and active way, rather than passively consuming it.

In 2017 I moved to London where I worked for a company called [Kano](https://kano.me/), developing [desktop apps](https://kano.me/landing/app/uk), [website](https://world.kano.me/challenges) and [embed software](https://murilopolese.github.io/kano-pixel-kit-pixel32-docs/).

In 2019 I went back to work (and play) with my beloved friends at [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/) where I took different roles developing software and content with educational focus.

In 2020 I had the honour and pleasure to work with [JoyLabz](https://joylabz.com/), one of the companies that most sparked my interest in prototyping, education and technology as well as becoming [literate on the world of inventions that surround us](https://www.ted.com/talks/jay_silver_hack_a_banana_make_a_keyboard).

In 2021 I joined [Blivande](https://blivande.com) house and community, where I participate on this experiment in stewarding and cultivating a co-created, participatory and self-sustaining ecosystem. Always becoming!

I'm actively looking for new, meaningful collaboration opportunities, connections and learning experiences.
