**Short version:**

I have worked as a full-stack software developer, creative technologist, consultant and leading R&D projects for the past 10+ years. I have experience developing interactive media for art installations, advertisement campaigns as well as developing and maintaining robust systems, databases, embedded software and infrastructure. For the past 5 years, I leveraged from my training as a Physics teacher and focused on my real passion: Empowering through playful education. I worked with companies such as [Kano](https://kano.me), Quirkbot, [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/) and [JoyLabz](https://joylabz.com/). I also participate, run and am an ambassador of [Science Hack Day](http://sciencehackday.org/ambassador/) and [Kids Hack Day](https://www.kidshackday.com/about) hackathons.

**Long version:**

I started studying Physics in **2007** at my hometown’s university (UFES). There I did internships working as an educator in an after school program and science museum, both targeting children at social risk. I also got involved with the modelling laboratory where they developed software simulations to be used by teachers and students in classroom.

In **2009** I left the Physics course and became a software developer due to the financial pressure of being a <del>hero</del> teacher in Brazil. As a developer I worked in a range of places that dealt with the impacts of modern technology in our lives including the government’s culture department, a [projection mapping art collective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp4usRl-nSg) and running my startup. I also became a [Science Hack Day Ambassador](http://sciencehackday.org/ambassador/)!

In **2014**, I moved to Sweden where I worked as a creative technologist in a [digital agency](https://oakwood.se/), as a consultant for a [strategic design firm](https://www.designit.com/) and first got involved with a non-profit organisation called [Kids Hack Day](http://www.kidshackday.com/). While volunteering at Kids Hack Day I had the pleasure to develop some of the features of [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/) and [Quirkbot](https://www.quirkbot.com/), toys designed to engage kids in perceiving that we can interact with technology more creatively and actively, rather than passively consuming it.

In **2017** I moved to London where I worked for a company called [Kano](https://kano.me/), developing [desktop apps](https://kano.me/landing/app/uk), [websites](https://world.kano.me/challenges) and [embedded software](https://murilopolese.github.io/kano-pixel-kit-pixel32-docs/).

In **2019** I went back to work (and play) with my beloved friends at [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/) where I took different roles developing software and content with an educational focus.

**2020** started with the pandemic taking away some of my dreams and giving me others. I left Strawbees and enrolled on an online course called ["Recreating the Past" at School for Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.io/recreatingthepast-spring2020/). I moved back to Stockholm and started working with [JoyLabz](https://joylabz.com/), one of the companies that sparked my interest in prototyping, education and technology (as well as thinking about [invention literacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibrwte1QqUE)).

In **2021** I joined [Blivande](https://blivande.com) house, where I participate of an experiment in self-stewarding. There we cultivate a co-created, participatory and self-sustaining ecosystem. Always becoming! I have also become an active member of JoyLabz R&D team, lectured at [Konstfack](https://www.konstfack.se/en/), worked as Industry Leader at [Hyper Island](https://www.hyperisland.com/) and worked on restructuring and co-teaching the course [Recreating the Past at School for Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.io/fall-2021/rtp/index.html).
