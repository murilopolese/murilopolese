I'm a creative technologist, consultant, researcher and full-stack developer.

I have experience with interactive media art for installations and advertisement campaigns but also developing and maintaining robust systems, databases, embed software and infrastructure.

I am currently focusing on education and technology. I have worked with companies such as [Strawbees](https://strawbees.com/), Quirkbot, [Kano](https://kano.me) and [Arduino](https://arduino.cc). I am an ambassador of [Kids Hack Day](https://www.kidshackday.com/about) and [Science Hack Day](http://sciencehackday.org/ambassador/) hackathons.

I have taught and facilitated courses at [School for Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.study/), [Konsftack](https://www.konstfack.se/), [Berghs](https://berghs.se), [Hyper Island](https://www.hyperisland.com) and [Vefskoli](https://vefskoli.is).
