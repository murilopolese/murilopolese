			<h3>Kids Hack Day</h3>
			<p>
				Kids Hack Day is a global series of free creative tech events for kids.
				We give kids tools to express their creativity, be curious and
				empathetic towards each other and the world around them. We empower
				kids to take control over their own future and not just passively
				consume what someone else has designed for them.
			</p>
			<p>
				At Kids Hack Day I've been coorganizing and running a few events,
				summer camps and a regular club where kids can come and hack their
				way through their ideas. I have been also deeply involved on how to
				organize the events in a way the community can benefit from great
				documentation and the events maximize its pedagogical potentials.

			<h3>Science Hack Day</h3>
			<p>
				Science Hack Day is a two-day-all-night event where anyone excited
				about making weird, silly or serious things with science comes together
				in the same physical space to see what they can prototype within 24
				consecutive hours. The mission of Science Hack Day is to get excited
				and make things with science.
			</p>
			<p>
				After I organized a Science Hack Day in my hometown in Brazil I was
				selected by their ambassador program and went to the international
				edition of the event in San Francisco where our team won the music
				category.
