I went to Vejle with Carl BÃ¤rstad to join a national conference of schools who had or wanted to have a FabLab at their schools. We ran a workshop with a classic Quirkbot activity: Build a moving creature with Strawbees and a pre-programmed Quirkbot in 20 to 30 minutes. After the build we suggested a few competitions like a races or battles and participants interacted with each other creations.

A wide range of people attended to the workshop: Children, parents, teachers and other members of the school who were there to help decide on budgets for schools to invest in technology education.

I found this a quite unique opportunity to learn from so many different perspectives what people were expecting from the workshop and from the Quirkbots we were using. I was specially happy that we were able have some fun moments with everyone who participated!

We were also talking about Kids Hack Day and Quirkbot on a booth next to other fantastic projects and companies such as Lego.
