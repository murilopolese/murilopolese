Yet on the first month after I joined Kano I hosted a table at Code Dojo Girls Girls Only edition. The day was dedicated to spark curiosity and build confidence on girls about technology. There was scratch, game development, robotics, python programming and I was in charge of a “make your own computer” workshop with computer kits from Kano.

After putting together their computer and boot the operating system, girls from a range of ages used programming languages to draw, hack minecraft and pong on the computer kits. The reception was fantastic and it’s always a warm feeling when you can feel a new perspective unfolding in front of a young mind. It is especially important when this happens to youth who social or gender circumstances would put them on an underprivileged situation.

[I wrote a blog post on Kano’s blog about it!](https://kano.me/blog/we-attended-a-coder-dojo-girls-only-hackathon-it-was-awesome/)
