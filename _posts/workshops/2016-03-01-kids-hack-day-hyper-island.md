After Hyper Island bought Quirkbot kits for prototyping and development of projects, students organized a Kids Hack Day with it. I joined the event with my friend [Carl Bärstad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlbarstad/) as volunteer and consultant both training the students and helping to design the space.

The event was drop in and lasted for the whole day. It consisted of an open space with multiple stations: an inspiration station with examples of what they could build, free building with Strawbees, toy hacking and soldering, programming lights and motors and 3D printing.
