After Hyper Island bought Quirkbot kits for prototyping and development of projects, students organized a Kids Hack Day with it. I joined the event with Carl BÃ¤rstad as volunteer and consultant both training the students and helping to design the space.

The event was drop in and went through the whole day. After going through a reception where participants would register themselves they entered in an open space with multiple stations. There was an inspiration station with examples of what they could build, free building with Strawbees, toy hacking and soldering, programming lights and motors and 3D printing.
