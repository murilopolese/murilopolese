During the days I joined Maker Faire as part of the Strawbees gang, we camped on a booth next to the gift shop. Apart from business and marketing related activities, we had a lot of fun.

Before the fair started we gathered for one night of intense building with the goal to invent as many examples and props for the booth as possible. We had a great time!

It was a huge opportunity for me to be around so many talented and inspiring people and be able to experiment and build together! Many of the things we created for that booth are still part of Strawbees and Quirkbot portfolio of main activities.

Other than that our booth was a drop in building party, anyone could come, sit and play as much as they wanted with guided introductions provided by us, playing with the examples or digging the bags of Strawbees and straws to build ideas.
