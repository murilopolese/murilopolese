In early February, my friend 2018 Taylor and I decided to give a few workshops called "Fun with motors". We came up with this idea after a series of small activities we have done together to brainstorm about how could we explore motors, building, GPIOs and Kano products together. We thought this was a way to expand the possibilities for schools and homes who have Kano Computers and are done with the content that comes on it already.

We introduced Strawbees as the framework for creating physical structures while Kano would be the brain to store the coding structures. The main challenge and theme for this workshop was "build an automated marble run/roller coaster".
