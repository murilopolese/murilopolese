That way, the attendees could get to know a bit more about who else was coming and start setting up the mingling mood, months ahead of the event!"

[Blend](http://blendfest.ca/) is an animation conference-style party in Vancouver. I had the pleasure to work on their website and bring to life a great idea: What if each attendee could create a character that would appear on the home page? So the atendees could check who else is comming and setting up the mingling mood!
