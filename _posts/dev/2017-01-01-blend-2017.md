[Blend](http://blendfest.ca/) is an animation conference-style party in Vancouver. I had the pleasure to work on their website and bring to life a great idea: What if each attendee could create a character that would appear on the home page? So the atendees could check who else is comming and setting up the mingling mood!

You should definitely click around the characters and even try to make your own: Click on "join the party" and use the ticket code ABC123 to play with the character creator (nothing will be saved)!
