Punanimation was founded in April 2015, by 3 friends: [Bee Grandinetti](https://www.beegrandinetti.com/), [Hedvig Ahlberg](https://vimeo.com/hedvigahlberg) and [Linn Fritz](http://www.linnfritz.com/).

Although we were originally just 3, today our whole community is built by over 2000 women, trans and non-binary friends from all over the world, working within the many different fields and specializations of animation and motion graphics.

I had the pleasure to set up and build the [Punanimation Directory](http://punanimation.com). No more excuses for male-only studios, speaker line-ups and director rosters. Diversity exists, it's got skills and it's here.
