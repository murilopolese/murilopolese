Around February 2017 I got in touch with [Serious Business](http://seriousbusiness.agency/). This agency with a fun name and ridiculously talented team was working on [Reykjavik's Fashion Festival](http://work.seriousbusiness.agency/rff/) branding and website. I was convinced to jump in no matter what I would do just by checking out the slides and deck they sent me. I worked on a [tool](http://work.seriousbusiness.agency/rff/4/) they used to explore and export a visual piece that represented one of the natural elements present in the branding: Wind. I kept their initial setup on processing mostly adding some performance and GUI. You can [check the code on this gist](https://gist.github.com/murilopolese/3d7de2f5ef30d36737273567ff96795e).
